# Agent Orchestration Platform - Project Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our implementation plan for aligning the current codebase with the target architecture defined in the agent orchestration platform final design. We follow a test-driven development approach, ensuring high-quality implementation with comprehensive test coverage. Following our critical review, this plan has been updated to address identified gaps and ensure stronger alignment with our goals.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Target 100% test coverage with strategic exclusions
   - Use proper mocking for dependencies

2. **Quality First**
   - Code with MyPy and Ruff compliance from the start
   - Follow SOLID principles and clean code practices
   - Use Protocol interfaces for service contracts
   - Implement proper error handling and validation

3. **Incremental Progress**
   - Complete one module at a time
   - Create small, testable increments of functionality
   - Document architecture decisions

## Current Status

Our system currently provides:
- A framework for AI agent orchestration with service registry and lifecycle management
- Neo4j service for knowledge graph operations (partially implemented)
- Kafka service for message passing (completed with good test coverage)
- Configuration and logging frameworks (implemented with moderate test coverage)
- Agent capabilities for search and summarization (partially aligned with design patterns)

Test coverage currently stands at 58% across the codebase, with significant gaps in core services like Neo4j (7% coverage). All 220 existing tests pass successfully.

## Priority Objectives

### Objective 1: Fix Kafka Integration Tests (COMPLETED)

**Description:**
The current Kafka integration tests fail because they require a running Kafka broker. We need to implement proper mocking or develop a test infrastructure that doesn't rely on external services.

**Progress Update:**
- Implemented dependency injection in the Confluent Kafka service classes to support mocking
- Created a mock implementation in `tests/utils/mock_kafka.py` that can be used for testing without a real broker
- Modified the `ConfluentBaseKafkaProducer` and `ConfluentBaseKafkaConsumer` classes to accept pre-configured producers/consumers
- Updated the `ConfluentKafkaService` class to use the injectable components
- All Kafka tests now pass with 87% test coverage for the Kafka service implementation

**Remaining Work:**
- Add environmental detection to automatically switch between mock and real implementations
- Implement more comprehensive fault tolerance tests

### Objective 2: Neo4j Service Implementation and Testing (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)

**Description:**
The Neo4j service is critical for storing and querying the knowledge graph. We need to ensure the service implementation is thoroughly tested and aligned with the service protocol.

**Progress Update:**
- Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/services/test_neo4j_service.py`
- Fixed Neo4j database configuration issues in tests
- Implemented tests for node creation, relationship management, and graph queries
- All Neo4j service tests now pass, verifying core graph operations
- Achieved proper test coverage for the MockNeo4jService (70%)

**Remaining Work:**
- Increase test coverage for the core Neo4j service (currently at 7%)
- Implement proper connection management and error handling
- Improve transaction management for graph operations
- Create abstraction for complex query building
- Add integration tests with a real Neo4j instance

**Estimated Completion:** 2 weeks

### Objective 3: Capability Pattern Alignment (IN PROGRESS)

**Description:**
Refactor agent capabilities to follow consistent patterns for better maintainability and testability. Specifically, the SummarizeCapability needs to be aligned with the improved SearchCapability implementation.

**Tasks:**
1. Refactor SummarizeCapability to use Pydantic models for parameter validation
2. Leverage the base class's execute_with_lifecycle method for event handling
3. Fix error handling to use the centralized error framework
4. Align event handling with BaseCapability standard events
5. Update tests to verify consistent behavior while maintaining backward compatibility
6. Document pattern decisions and rationale

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- SummarizeCapability follows the same pattern as SearchCapability
- All tests pass with 100% coverage for both capabilities
- Documentation explains the capability pattern clearly
- Error handling is consistent and robust

**Estimated Completion:** 1 week

### Objective 4: Address Test Coverage Gaps (NEW)

**Description:**
Our current test coverage of 58% is far below our target of 100%. We need to systematically address gaps, prioritizing critical components and services.

**Tasks:**
1. Create test coverage report to identify critical gaps
2. Prioritize tests for Neo4j service implementation (currently 7% coverage)
3. Add tests for agent protocol implementation
4. Improve testing for error handling and edge cases
5. Create integration tests for cross-component workflows

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Test coverage increases to at least 80% overall
- Neo4j service reaches at least 70% test coverage
- Integration tests validate cross-component workflows
- Tests validate error handling and recovery scenarios

**Estimated Completion:** 3 weeks

### Objective 5: Implement Human-in-the-Loop Approval (NEW)

**Description:**
A core goal of our platform is supporting human-AI collaboration, but the approval workflow for agent transitions is incomplete. We need to implement this critical feature.

**Tasks:**
1. Design the approval workflow for agent state transitions
2. Implement the event-based approval mechanism
3. Create interfaces for human approval (API endpoints)
4. Add capability-based control for agent operations
5. Document the approval patterns and integration points

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agents can request approval for state transitions
- Humans can review and approve/deny requests
- System maintains audit trail of approvals
- Capability-based controls restrict agent operations appropriately
- Complete test coverage of approval workflows

**Estimated Completion:** 2 weeks

### Objective 6: Type System and Validation Improvements (NEW)

**Description:**
Incomplete type annotations and inconsistent validation make the codebase less maintainable and reduce the effectiveness of static analysis tools.

**Tasks:**
1. Audit codebase for missing or incomplete type annotations
2. Add comprehensive type hints to all public interfaces
3. Implement consistent validation patterns using Pydantic
4. Configure and run MyPy with strict settings
5. Add runtime type checking for critical interfaces

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All public interfaces have complete type annotations
- MyPy runs successfully with strict mode enabled
- Validation is consistent across similar components
- Documentation explains type and validation patterns

**Estimated Completion:** 1 week

### Objective 7: Architecture Documentation (NEW)

**Description:**
The codebase lacks comprehensive documentation of architectural decisions, making it difficult for new contributors to understand design choices and properly extend the system.

**Tasks:**
1. Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for key system components
2. Document service boundaries and responsibilities
3. Create developer guides for extending the system
4. Document event patterns and message flows
5. Add comprehensive docstrings to all public interfaces

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ADRs explain rationale for key architectural decisions
- Documentation covers all extension points
- Event patterns and message flows are clearly explained
- All public interfaces have docstrings with examples

**Estimated Completion:** 1 week

### Objective 8: Import Structure Refactoring (NEW)

**Description:**
The current import structure has led to conflicts and makes testing more difficult. We need to restructure imports to avoid package conflicts and reduce coupling.

**Tasks:**
1. Restructure test directories to avoid namespace conflicts
2. Audit imports for circular dependencies
3. Implement explicit dependency injection where appropriate
4. Document import best practices

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No import conflicts between test and production code
- No circular dependencies in the codebase
- Clear dependency flow documented
- Tests can run independently without unexpected side effects

**Estimated Completion:** 1 week
