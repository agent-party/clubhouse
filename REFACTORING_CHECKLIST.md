## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Principles
1. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Target 100% test coverage with strategic exclusions
   - Use proper mocking for dependencies

2. **Quality First**
   - Follow SOLID principles and clean code practices
   - Use Protocol interfaces for service contracts
   - Always add comprehensive type annotations
   - Implement proper error handling and validation

3. **Incremental Progress**
   - Work on one module at a time until complete
   - Create small, testable increments of functionality
   - Remove debug code and commented-out sections after use

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Incremental Module Completion**: Focus on one module at a time, ensuring it's well-tested before moving on
2. **Protocol-First Design**: Define clear interfaces before implementation to enforce proper abstraction
3. **Test Coverage Gates**: Establish minimum test coverage thresholds (90%+) for critical components
4. **Documentation-Driven Development**: Document design decisions and architecture to ensure consistency
5. **Regular Architectural Reviews**: Periodically review the system design against project goals to prevent drift

### Success Criteria
1. All tests pass for implemented components
2. No circular dependencies in the codebase
3. All validation uses Pydantic models
4. Consistent error handling across all components
5. Clear inheritance hierarchy for agents and capabilities
6. At least 80% test coverage overall (target: 100%)
7. Complete type annotations with mypy compliance
8. Neo4j service implementation reaches 70% coverage
9. Documentation updated for all refactored components
10. All capability implementations follow standardized patterns
