# System Architecture

## Overview

The Agent Orchestration Platform implements a modular, layered architecture that separates concerns and enables flexible composition of components. Following SOLID principles and clean code practices, the architecture prioritizes reliability, testability, and extensibility.

## Core Architectural Principles

1. **Protocol-Based Interfaces**: All components communicate through well-defined protocols
2. **Dependency Injection**: Services are registered and retrieved through a central Service Registry
3. **Event-Driven Communication**: Components interact through standardized events
4. **Repository Pattern**: Data access is abstracted through repositories
5. **Capability-Based Design**: Agent functionality is encapsulated in reusable capabilities

## Layered Architecture

### 1. Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer provides foundational services for the platform:

- **Database Connectivity**: Abstractions for Neo4j graph database operations
- **Message Broker**: Kafka integration for reliable message delivery
- **Service Registry**: Central registry for dependency management
- **Configuration Management**: Type-safe configuration using Pydantic models
- **Logging and Telemetry**: Structured logging and observability

### 2. Domain Layer

The domain layer contains the core business logic and entities:

- **Agent Protocols**: Interface definitions for agent communication
- **Capability Interfaces**: Abstract base classes for agent capabilities
- **Event System**: Event definitions and handler mechanisms
- **State Management**: Agent state transition logic
- **Error Framework**: Centralized error handling and propagation

### 3. Application Layer

The application layer orchestrates the use cases and workflow:

- **Agent Factory**: Creates and configures specialized agents
- **Capability Registry**: Discovers and manages available capabilities
- **Workflow Engine**: Coordinates multi-agent evolutionary processes
- **Human Approval System**: Manages human-in-the-loop approval workflows
- **Monitoring & Control**: Provides oversight of agent operations

### 4. Interface Layer

The interface layer enables interaction with the platform:

- **API Gateway**: REST and GraphQL interfaces for external systems
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line tools for administration and testing
- **Web Interface**: UI for human operators to monitor and interact
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time updates for active sessions
- **Integration Adapters**: Connectors for external systems

## Component Architecture

### Agent System

The Agent system follows a capability-based design pattern:

```
BaseAgent
├── AgentState (Managed by Neo4j persistence)
├── MessageHandler
├── Capabilities
│   ├── SearchCapability
│   ├── SummarizeCapability
│   ├── GeneratorCapability
│   ├── CriticCapability
│   ├── RefinerCapability
│   └── EvaluatorCapability
└── EventSystem
```

Specialized agent types extend the BaseAgent with specific capability combinations:

```
AssistantAgent extends BaseAgent
CreativeAgent extends BaseAgent
AnalyticalAgent extends BaseAgent
```

### Service Registry

The Service Registry implements the Service Locator pattern combined with dependency injection:

```
ServiceRegistry
├── register_service(protocol, implementation)
├── get_service(protocol)
└── Lifecycle Hooks
    ├── initialize()
    └── shutdown()
```

### Neo4j Persistence

The Neo4j integration provides graph-based persistence:

```
Neo4jService
├── Connection Management
├── Session Management
├── Query Execution
├── Transaction Support
└── Data Modeling
```

## Communication Patterns

The system implements several communication patterns:

1. **Request-Response**: Synchronous communication between components
2. **Publish-Subscribe**: Event-based asynchronous communication
3. **Command-Query Separation**: Distinct patterns for commands and queries
4. **Saga Pattern**: For long-running, multi-step processes

## Error Handling

Error handling follows a centralized approach:

1. **Error Hierarchy**: Specialized exception types
2. **Error Propagation**: Consistent error propagation patterns
3. **Error Responses**: Standardized error response formats
4. **Circuit Breakers**: For resilience against cascading failures

## Security Model

The security model implements capability-based security:

1. **Authentication**: Identity verification for users and systems
2. **Authorization**: Permission verification for operations
3. **Capability Control**: Restrictions on agent capabilities
4. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security events

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture addresses scalability through:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless components enable horizontal scaling
2. **Partitioning**: Message and data partitioning for load distribution
3. **Caching**: Strategic caching of frequently accessed data
4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations where possible

## Evolution and Extensibility

The architecture supports evolution through:

1. **Plugin System**: Extensibility through capability plugins
2. **Version Compatibility**: Clear interface versioning
3. **Feature Flags**: Runtime control of feature availability
4. **Configuration-Driven Behavior**: Adjustable behavior without code changes
