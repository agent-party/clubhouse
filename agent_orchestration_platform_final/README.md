# Agent Orchestration Platform

A unified platform enabling AI agents to collaborate with humans and evolve through interaction, built on a foundation of MCP, OpenAI Agent Library, Kafka, and Neo4j.

## Project Vision

The Agent Orchestration Platform creates a home for AI agents to collaborate effectively with humans, leveraging the unique strengths of both. The platform supports agent evolution through feedback and structured learning, enabling increasingly valuable human-AI collaboration in domains like education, business, and creative work.

## Core Principles

1. **Human-AI Collaboration** - Create win-win situations that leverage the strengths of both humans and AI agents
2. **Evolution through Feedback** - Enable agents to improve through structured feedback and learning
3. **Interoperability** - Use standardized protocols for seamless integration across systems
4. **Knowledge Representation** - Store and utilize agent knowledge in a structured, queryable form
5. **Event-Driven Architecture** - Build responsive systems that react to real-world events and interactions

## Technology Stack

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - Standardized communication layer for agent capabilities
- **OpenAI Agent Library** - Powerful AI capabilities through specialized assistants
- **Apache Kafka** - Scalable event streaming for system-wide communication
- **Neo4j** - Graph database for complex agent knowledge and relationships

## Documentation Structure

- **[Architecture](architecture/)** - System design, component interactions, and technical foundations
- **[Implementation Guide](implementation_guide/)** - Detailed specifications for implementing system components
- **[Test Scenarios](test_scenarios/)** - Structured test cases spanning multiple domains
- **[Implementation Examples](implementation_examples/)** - Working code examples demonstrating core functionality
- **[Development](development/)** - Setup guides and contribution workflows

## Development Approach

### Test-Driven Development
- Write tests before implementation
- Target 100% test coverage with strategic exclusions
- Use proper mocking for dependencies

### Quality First
- Follow SOLID principles and clean code practices
- Use Protocol interfaces for service contracts
- Add comprehensive type annotations
- Implement proper error handling and validation

### Incremental Progress
- Work on one module at a time until complete
- Create small, testable increments of functionality
- Remove debug code and commented-out sections after use

## Getting Started

1. Review the [architecture documents](architecture/) to understand the system design
2. Follow the [development setup guide](development/setup_guide.md) to configure your environment
3. Explore the [implementation examples](implementation_examples/) to see working examples
4. Choose a component from the [implementation guide](implementation_guide/) to start development
