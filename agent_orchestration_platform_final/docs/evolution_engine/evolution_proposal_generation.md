# Evolution Proposal Generation

## Overview

This document outlines how the Evolution Engine generates improvement proposals for agents based on observed data and user feedback. The process combines pattern analysis, memory processing, and targeted prompt engineering.

## Process Flow

1. **Data Collection** → **Pattern Analysis** → **Proposal Formulation** → **Priority Assignment** → **Review Preparation**

## Data Collection

The system aggregates data from multiple sources:

```python
async def collect_evolution_data(agent_id, time_period):
    """Collect data for evolution analysis."""
    return {
        "performance_metrics": await metrics_service.get_agent_metrics(agent_id, time_period),
        "user_feedback": await feedback_service.get_user_feedback(agent_id, time_period),
        "error_logs": await logging_service.get_agent_errors(agent_id, time_period),
        "memory_insights": await memory_service.get_trending_topics(agent_id, time_period),
        "capability_usage": await capability_service.get_usage_statistics(agent_id, time_period)
    }
```

## Pattern Analysis

The system identifies patterns worth addressing:

```python
def analyze_patterns(evolution_data):
    """Analyze collected data for evolution patterns."""
    patterns = []
    
    # Performance degradation patterns
    if has_declining_metrics(evolution_data["performance_metrics"]):
        patterns.append({
            "type": "performance_decline",
            "confidence": calculate_confidence(evolution_data["performance_metrics"]),
            "metrics": extract_declining_metrics(evolution_data["performance_metrics"])
        })
    
    # Recurring errors
    error_clusters = cluster_errors(evolution_data["error_logs"])
    for cluster in error_clusters:
        if cluster["count"] > ERROR_THRESHOLD:
            patterns.append({
                "type": "recurring_error",
                "confidence": min(1.0, cluster["count"] / 20.0),
                "error_type": cluster["type"],
                "examples": cluster["examples"][:3]
            })
    
    # Underutilized capabilities
    for capability, usage in evolution_data["capability_usage"].items():
        if usage["count"] < USAGE_THRESHOLD and usage["success_rate"] > 0.8:
            patterns.append({
                "type": "underutilized_capability",
                "confidence": 0.7,
                "capability": capability,
                "usage_count": usage["count"]
            })
    
    # User feedback themes
    feedback_themes = extract_feedback_themes(evolution_data["user_feedback"])
    for theme in feedback_themes:
        if theme["sentiment"] < 0 and theme["count"] > FEEDBACK_THRESHOLD:
            patterns.append({
                "type": "negative_feedback_theme",
                "confidence": min(1.0, theme["count"] / 10.0),
                "theme": theme["topic"],
                "examples": theme["examples"][:3]
            })
    
    return patterns
```

## Proposal Generation Prompts

Each pattern type has a specialized prompt for proposal generation:

### Performance Decline Prompt

```
Analyze the following performance metrics that have declined for agent "{agent_name}":
{metrics_details}

Based on these metrics and the agent's current configuration:
1. What specific improvements could address these performance issues?
2. How might these changes impact other aspects of the agent's functionality?
3. What are the potential risks of implementing these changes?

Formulate 2-3 specific, actionable evolution proposals that would address these performance issues.
```

### Recurring Error Prompt

```
Review these recurring errors from agent "{agent_name}":
{error_examples}

These errors have occurred {error_count} times in the past {time_period}.

Based on the error patterns:
1. What is the likely root cause of these errors?
2. What specific changes to the agent would prevent these errors?
3. How would these changes affect the agent's overall behavior?

Provide 1-2 detailed evolution proposals that would effectively eliminate these errors.
```

### User Feedback Prompt

```
Analyze this negative user feedback about agent "{agent_name}":
{feedback_examples}

This theme appeared in {feedback_count} user interactions.

Based on this feedback:
1. What aspect of the agent is not meeting user expectations?
2. What specific changes would better align the agent with user needs?
3. Are there any tradeoffs to consider with these changes?

Formulate 2-3 evolution proposals that directly address this feedback theme.
```

## Priority Scoring

Each proposal is assigned a priority score using a multi-factor evaluation:

```python
def calculate_proposal_priority(proposal, agent_data):
    """Calculate priority score for an evolution proposal."""
    # Impact assessment (0-1)
    impact_score = evaluate_impact(proposal, agent_data)
    
    # Implementation complexity (0-1, lower is simpler)
    complexity_score = evaluate_complexity(proposal)
    
    # User value assessment (0-1)
    user_value = evaluate_user_value(proposal, agent_data["user_feedback"])
    
    # Risk assessment (0-1, lower is less risky)
    risk_score = evaluate_risk(proposal, agent_data)
    
    # Combined weighted score
    priority = (impact_score * 0.4) + \
              (user_value * 0.3) + \
              ((1 - complexity_score) * 0.2) + \
              ((1 - risk_score) * 0.1)
    
    return {
        "score": priority,
        "impact": impact_score,
        "complexity": complexity_score,
        "user_value": user_value,
        "risk": risk_score,
        "tier": assign_priority_tier(priority)
    }
```

## Review Preparation

Proposals are packaged with supporting evidence for human review:

```python
def prepare_for_review(proposal, evidence, priority):
    """Prepare evolution proposal for human review."""
    return {
        "id": generate_proposal_id(),
        "agent_id": proposal["agent_id"],
        "title": proposal["title"],
        "description": proposal["description"],
        "changes": proposal["changes"],
        "evidence": format_evidence(evidence),
        "metrics": {
            "expected_impact": calculate_expected_impact(proposal),
            "implementation_effort": estimate_implementation_effort(proposal),
            "priority_score": priority["score"],
            "priority_tier": priority["tier"]
        },
        "status": "pending_review",
        "created_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
```

## Testing Evolution Proposal Generation

```python
def test_proposal_generation_quality():
    """Test quality of generated proposals."""
    # Arrange
    test_data = load_test_data()
    expected_proposals = load_expected_proposals()
    
    # Act
    patterns = analyze_patterns(test_data)
    proposals = generate_proposals(patterns, test_data["agent_id"])
    
    # Assert
    assert len(proposals) >= MIN_EXPECTED_PROPOSALS
    
    # Check proposal quality
    quality_scores = evaluate_proposal_quality(proposals)
    assert average(quality_scores) > QUALITY_THRESHOLD
    
    # Verify key issues are addressed
    key_issues = extract_key_issues(test_data)
    for issue in key_issues:
        assert any(addresses_issue(proposal, issue) for proposal in proposals)
```
