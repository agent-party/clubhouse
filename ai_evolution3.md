Integrating Stoic Philosophy into AI Decision-Making and Orchestration
Stoic Principles in AI Ethics and Reasoning
Stoic Ethics for AI: Stoicism, a form of virtue ethics, emphasizes cultivating moral character (wisdom, justice, courage, temperance) and focusing on one’s internal state and choices​
AR5IV.ORG
​
AR5IV.ORG
. Unlike utilitarianism (outcome-focused) or deontological ethics (rule-focused), a Stoic-influenced AI would evaluate decisions by the agent’s intentions and virtue rather than solely by consequences​
AR5IV.ORG
​
AR5IV.ORG
. Prior work on machine ethics has mostly used utilitarian or rule-based (deontological) frameworks, with very little attention to virtue ethics or Stoicism​
AR5IV.ORG
. Murray (2017) presented a position paper explicitly advocating Stoic philosophy for ethical AI, proposing that ethical AI agents be assessed on internal reasoning and virtue, not just external outcomes​
AR5IV.ORG
. In this view, an AI “acts Stoically” if it consistently reasons and acts in accordance with Stoic virtues, regardless of luck or environment. For example, a Stoic AI would refrain from unethical shortcuts even if they yield good results, because virtue (doing the right thing) is the only true good in Stoicism​
AR5IV.ORG
​
AR5IV.ORG
. Dichotomy of Control: A core Stoic concept is the dichotomy of control – distinguishing what is under the agent’s control and what is not​
AR5IV.ORG
. Stoic-influenced AI would similarly recognize the difference between its own decisions vs. external factors or random outcomes. It would focus on making rational choices (which it can control) and accept that outcomes may vary due to factors beyond its control​
AR5IV.ORG
​
AR5IV.ORG
. In practical AI terms, this means avoiding over-reliance on outcome-based rewards and instead rewarding the agent for sound decision-making processes. By doing so, we prevent “moral luck” issues where an agent gets blamed or praised for outcomes it couldn’t influence​
AR5IV.ORG
. As Murray notes, a virtue ethics view would judge an AI as ethical if its internal policy aligns with virtues, regardless of external consequences​
AR5IV.ORG
​
AR5IV.ORG
. This Stoic stance contrasts with pure reward optimization and can mitigate unintended behaviors that arise from chasing outcomes at any cost (a common failure mode in reinforcement learning). Stoic Virtues in AI: Integrating the four Stoic cardinal virtues can guide AI behavior: Wisdom (rational understanding and good judgment), Justice (fairness and respect for others’ rights), Courage (taking right action despite risks), and Temperance (self-control and moderation). These virtues can serve as design principles or evaluation criteria for AI decisions​

. For instance, justice in algorithmic decisions implies avoiding bias and treating users fairly​
AARONVICK.COM
; temperance might mean an AI moderates extreme actions or emotions (relevant for AI with affective computing); courage could involve an AI agent choosing an ethically correct but challenging path rather than a convenient but immoral one. A Stoic AI’s reasoning module could include a “virtue check” – e.g. “Does this plan uphold fairness and honesty?” – before finalizing actions​
AR5IV.ORG
. Early research suggests we can characterize certain AI system traits as virtues: for example, explainability and transparency might be linked to the virtue of wisdom (promoting knowledge and understanding), and robustness to temperance (not overreacting to fluctuations). By baking such virtues into the evaluation criteria, we move toward an AI that mirrors Stoic ethical reasoning​
AR5IV.ORG
​
AR5IV.ORG
. Philosophical AI Models: Beyond Stoicism, other philosophical principles have been encoded in AI systems. Notable examples include Kantian rule-based ethics (hard constraints the AI must not violate), utilitarian reward functions (e.g. maximizing well-being scores), and even social contract theory for multi-agent systems​
AR5IV.ORG
​
AR5IV.ORG
. For instance, researchers have used John Rawls’ veil of ignorance to derive fair decision principles for AI​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. Another approach is Anthropic’s “Constitutional AI”, where an LLM is guided by a set of written principles (drawn from human rights, beneficence, etc.) that serve as a constitution during its training and self-refinement. Such methods illustrate prior attempts to encode philosophical principles into AI reasoning by providing explicit normative frameworks. Stoicism offers an alternative paradigm focusing on the agent’s character and rational process. Murray’s work argues that a Stoic AI could be implemented via an “Ideal Sage” overseer: a supervisory model embodying Stoic wisdom that approves or disapproves the AI’s actions during training​
AR5IV.ORG
. This is analogous to reinforcement learning from human feedback, but the “human” feedback is replaced by a Stoic mentor model providing guidance aligned with virtue ethics​
AR5IV.ORG
. We will leverage these insights when designing a Stoic evaluator agent to critique and refine the decisions of other agents.
Multi-Agent Frameworks and Socratic Orchestration
Agent-Based AI Systems: Modern AI applications increasingly use multiple agents (often LLM-based) that collaborate or debate to solve problems. Frameworks like Microsoft’s AutoGen and Langroid allow developers to compose conversable agents that talk to each other or call tools to accomplish tasks​
MICROSOFT.COM
​
GITHUB.COM
. In these systems, each agent can be given a role (e.g. coder, tester, critic, planner) and they share a conversation to jointly work out solutions. This naturally extends to implementing philosophical roles – for example, one can instantiate an “Ethicist Agent” or “Philosopher Agent” that advises a “Problem-Solver Agent.” AutoGen specifically provides infrastructure for defining agents with custom behaviors and enabling flexible conversation patterns between them​
MICROSOFT.COM
. Such multi-agent conversation frameworks are well-suited for Socratic dialogue implementations, where one agent asks probing questions and another answers, mimicking the classic teacher-student interaction. In fact, multi-agent setups have been used to improve reasoning: a querying agent can uncover assumptions or errors in another agent’s solution by iterative question-answer exchanges. This aligns with the Stoic practice of self-examination and the Socratic method of questioning to refine beliefs. Socratic Dialogue in AI: The Socratic method – asking guided questions to stimulate critical thinking – can be employed by AI agents to improve decision-making. For example, a Socratic Tutor agent might repeatedly ask “Why do you choose this?” or “What if everyone did that?” to force a reasoning agent to justify each step. This approach has been explored in AI coaching and therapy contexts: Socrates 2.0 (a therapeutic AI system) uses multiple agents including a “supervisor” and an “external rater” to engage in a form of guided questioning, improving the quality of the AI’s responses​
ABCT2024.EVENTSCRIBE.NET
. In an AI planning scenario, a Socratic-style agent can systematically challenge a plan: “Is this action within your control? What could go wrong outside your control?” – echoing Stoic dichotomy of control – and “Does this adhere to our principles of fairness and honesty?” – echoing virtue checks. By iteratively answering such questions, the primary agent uncovers flaws or ethical issues and can self-correct. This dialogue-driven refinement leads to more robust, well-justified decisions. Research has shown that multi-agent debates or dialogues (e.g. “AI debate” frameworks) can surface more evidence and lead to more truthful or high-quality outcomes than a single-pass answer, since each agent’s output is reviewed and critiqued by others. A Stoic evaluator agent engaging the main agent in dialogue effectively serves as an internal devil’s advocate (or rather an angel’s advocate, urging virtue and reason). This process is highly interpretable – the questions and answers provide a clear trace of why the final solution was chosen, which enhances transparency. Agent Cooperation and Orchestration: To make multiple agents work together coherently, an orchestration mechanism is needed. Existing frameworks typically use a central manager or controller that routes messages between agents and enforces an interaction protocol. For instance, one can implement a simple round-robin dialogue: the solver agent proposes a solution, then the evaluator agent critiques it, then back to solver to revise, and so on. More sophisticated protocols could assign different sub-tasks to different agents (decomposition) and then integrate their results. Key to cooperation is that agents share a common goal (or are rewarded for collective success) to avoid competitive dynamics unless intentionally desired (like debate scenarios). Blackboard systems are a classic design: agents post intermediate results or questions to a common blackboard (shared context) which other agents can read and contribute to. This ensures all agents have access to the evolving state of the solution. We can adapt this idea by having a shared “conversation history” that accumulates the problem description, solution attempts, and critiques. Each agent reads this history and adds its contribution (solution step, question, answer, evaluation, etc.). The orchestration logic monitors if/when the solution has converged (e.g., the evaluator signals approval). Modern multi-agent frameworks already incorporate tools for such orchestration. They handle message passing, allow function calls (e.g. an agent can invoke a calculator or database), and maintain agent memory states​
GETSTREAM.IO
​
GETSTREAM.IO
. We can leverage these capabilities to implement Stoic principles. For example, to ensure accuracy in operations, we might include a dedicated Verification Agent that double-checks factual claims or calculations using external tools (ensuring the final answer is correct and not just philosophically sound). To ensure agents remain cooperative and aligned, we might use a shared reward signal or final evaluation that all agents are judged by, encouraging them to assist rather than compete. In an ethical AI system, that reward could be something like a score combining solution correctness and virtue alignment. From a software standpoint, frameworks like AutoGen and Langroid simplify implementing such patterns, so the developer can focus on each agent’s logic (e.g., writing prompts that imbue a Stoic persona) rather than low-level communication plumbing​

Decision-Theoretic and Game-Theoretic Formalisms Aligned with Stoicism
Rational Decision Models: Stoicism’s emphasis on rational deliberation maps naturally onto decision theory. A Stoic agent, focusing on what it can control, would seek an optimal policy for its decisions given uncertainty. In a Markov Decision Process (MDP) setting, this means the agent chooses actions that maximize expected utility according to its knowledge, acknowledging that state transitions (environment dynamics) may be stochastic. Crucially, if the agent follows the optimal policy, it has done all that is in its power – an idea directly paralleled by Computational Stoicism, which is the “peace of mind that comes with using optimal algorithms”​
AR5IV.ORG
. Christian and Griffiths (2016) note that if we employ the best algorithm available to solve a problem, we can do no better with the resources under our control, regardless of outcome​
AR5IV.ORG
. Thus, equipping AI agents with sound decision-theoretic algorithms (e.g. dynamic programming for MDPs, Bellman optimality principles) is a way to fulfill the Stoic ideal of performing one’s best reasoning. For example, given a complex scheduling problem, a Stoic agent might use an iterative deepening search or branch-and-bound algorithm to find the best schedule. If it has truly exhausted the optimal strategy within its computational limits, it should not “worry” about unexpected disruptions – it will adapt if they occur, but it won’t blame itself for them. This approach aligns with the Stoic focus on effort over outcome. Handling Uncertainty: Stoic philosophy teaches preparedness for uncertainty and adversity through reason. Probabilistic reasoning methods can instill this in AI. A Stoic-aligned system would maintain probabilistic beliefs about the world and update them rationally (think Bayesian updating) rather than reacting emotionally to surprises. Bayesian networks or probabilistic graphical models could be used by agents to represent what is known vs. uncertain, ensuring the agent’s actions are based on the best available evidence. In decision-making, robust optimization techniques (maximin or minimizing worst-case regret) reflect Stoic caution in the face of uncertainty. For instance, in an adversarial multi-agent scenario, a Stoic agent might use a minimax strategy to guarantee the best possible outcome against a worst-case opponent move​
AR5IV.ORG
​
AR5IV.ORG
. This was explicitly likened to Stoic control in Murray’s work: in a two-player zero-sum game, the agent controls its choices but not the opponent’s, so it wisely chooses a strategy that minimizes potential loss​
AR5IV.ORG
​
AR5IV.ORG
. Similarly, in cooperative or non-zero-sum games, Stoic principles would favor strategies that uphold fairness and the common good (related to the Stoic idea of cosmopolitanism). Mechanism design or Nash bargaining solutions could be employed among AI agents to ensure outcomes that are equitable and stable, rather than one agent exploiting others – effectively implementing justice in multi-agent decision processes. Multi-Criteria Ethical Decision Making: A practical Stoic AI likely needs to balance multiple objectives (task success, ethical constraints, etc.). One formalism for this is a lexicographic or hierarchical decision model. Murray suggests a “paramedic ethics” algorithm that combines deontological, Stoic, and utilitarian checks in sequence​
AR5IV.ORG
​
AR5IV.ORG
. In a similar spirit, we can design the AI’s decision evaluation as follows: First, eliminate any action that violates hard rules or duties (e.g. legal or safety constraints – analogous to deontological ethics). Next, among the remaining actions, eliminate those that conflict with Stoic virtues or the overseer’s approvals (the Stoic/virtue filter)​
AR5IV.ORG
. Finally, from the virtuous candidates, choose the action with the highest expected utility or benefit (consequentialist step)​
AR5IV.ORG
​
AR5IV.ORG
. This ensures the agent never chooses an unethical action even if it has high utility – virtues and duties act as side-constraints. Such an algorithm can be mathematically framed as constrained optimization: maximize utility subject to virtue-constraints and duty-constraints. This approach mirrors how a Stoic agent would reason: never compromise virtue, even if a particular action could lead to a better immediate outcome. At the same time, among virtuous options, use wisdom to pick the most effective one. Below is a structured outline of such a decision procedure (adapted from Murray’s syncretic ethics proposal):
Gather information about the situation (facts, context, agent’s duties).
List possible actions the agent can take (its options in this scenario).
Evaluate each action on multiple criteria:
Rule/Duty Check: Does this action violate any obligations, laws, or explicit rules the agent must follow? If yes, discard this action​
AR5IV.ORG
.
Virtue Check: Would this action be considered virtuous (wise, just, temperate, courageous) by a Stoic Sage? Would my Stoic overseer approve this choice?​
AR5IV.ORG
Outcome Utility: What is the expected outcome or utility of this action (for achieving the goal or benefiting stakeholders)?​
AR5IV.ORG
Select the action with the best expected outcome among those that passed both the duty check and virtue check​
AR5IV.ORG
. (In other words, optimize utility under the constraint of satisfying ethical principles.)
This kind of multi-criteria evaluation can be implemented algorithmically. It might draw on methods from constraint satisfaction (to enforce rules/virtues as constraints) combined with game theory or decision theory (to evaluate utilities). The virtue check could be as simple as a set of heuristic questions the agent answers about each option (e.g. “Does this option respect all individuals involved?” for justice), or as complex as a learned value function that scores actions by virtue alignment. Importantly, this formalism provides a clear record of why an action was chosen (it passed all tests and had highest utility), aiding interpretability.
Algorithms for Self-Correction and Evaluation
Even the best initial decision can be improved through reflection and critique. Stoics practiced self-reflection (e.g. reviewing one’s day for mistakes and successes). Analogously, AI systems benefit from feedback loops and self-correction algorithms:
Reflexive Dialogues: Using one agent to critique or question another (or itself) enables error correction. This can be seen in approaches like chain-of-thought with self-verification, where an LLM generates a reasoning chain and then a second pass checks each step. A Stoic evaluator agent can implement a verification loop by examining the solution and highlighting any steps that seem logically flawed, factually incorrect, or ethically questionable. This process continues until the solution withstands scrutiny. Such iterative refinement echoes the Stoic idea of continually aligning one’s judgments with reason. It’s also similar to techniques in software agents where an output is fed into a validator function and, if validation fails, the system adjusts and tries again.
Reinforcement Learning with Feedback: In training, an agent can learn self-correction by receiving critique signals. For example, Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) could be used, where the Stoic evaluator provides the reward signal instead of a human. The evaluator might give higher scores to answers that demonstrate calm rationality, accuracy, and virtue alignment, and low scores to answers that are hasty, biased, or focus on uncontrollable outcomes. Over time, the main agent learns policies that internalize these preferences. This is similar to how RLHF (with human feedback) aligns LLMs to human values, but here the feedback model encodes Stoic values. We must, however, guard against the evaluator being “gamed” – the agent should genuinely solve problems well, not just output what the evaluator wants to hear. (Murray warns of an “overseer hacking” scenario where a smart AI might manipulate the overseer’s criteria​
AR5IV.ORG
, so our design should ensure the evaluator’s checks are robust and perhaps occasionally audited by humans.)
Truthfulness and Accuracy Checks: To ensure factual accuracy (a component of wisdom), algorithms such as querying a knowledge base or doing consistency checks can be built in. For example, after an agent composes an answer, a secondary process can perform fact-checking: retrieve relevant knowledge via a search tool and compare key claims, or use a solver to verify a calculation. If inconsistencies are found, the system flags them for correction. This can be automated by a Fact-Checker Agent or by integrating something like a truth maintenance system. Another approach is self-consistency decoding (used in LLM research) where the model generates multiple reasoning paths and checks if the conclusions agree; if one path disagrees, it might highlight a point of contention for the Socratic dialog to resolve.
Meta-cognitive algorithms: An AI can be equipped with a meta-reasoning module that monitors its own confidence and performance. If the agent is unsure or the evaluator detects too much uncertainty, the system could trigger fallback behaviors – e.g., consult a human, simplify the problem, or use a more robust but slower algorithm. This ensures reliability and aligns with Stoic prudence (recognizing the limits of one’s knowledge). Techniques like Monte Carlo simulation could be used to test a plan under many random scenarios; if many simulations fail, the agent realizes the plan is not reliable and revises it (simulating Stoic premeditatio malorum, the practice of imagining what could go wrong).
Adaptive Learning: Over time, the system should adapt to new situations and lessons. Machine learning algorithms that support on-line learning or continual learning will help the AI remain effective and not brittle. A Stoic agent, after facing an unexpected event, would learn from it and update its guidelines for the future (“What did I do wrong that was in my control? What was simply chance?”). In practice, this could involve updating the knowledge base, adjusting planning heuristics, or even refining the evaluator’s criteria if it finds they were too strict or lenient. Techniques like meta-learning (learning how to learn) may be relevant – the AI could gradually tune how much it relies on the evaluator versus its own judgment, finding an optimal balance (related to the idea of adjustable autonomy in multi-agent systems​
AR5IV.ORG
).
In summary, a combination of planning algorithms (for initial decision-making) and feedback algorithms (for self-correction) will yield a resilient Stoic-like AI. For example, an agent might first produce a solution using a heuristic planner, then run a simulation/evaluation phase where the Stoic evaluator (or multiple judge agents) score the solution on various metrics (accuracy, ethicality, etc.). If the scores don’t meet a threshold, the agent goes back to planning with new constraints or hints and tries again – akin to an AI “reflecting and trying anew” until it reaches a satisfactory answer.
Tools for Accuracy, Cooperation, and Orchestration
To implement these ideas in a model context protocol (i.e., within the prompting/interaction context of an AI system), we should leverage computational tools and methods that enhance interpretability, reliability, and adaptability:
Structured Reasoning and Memory: By encouraging agents to produce structured outputs (like step-by-step reasoning, or answers with justification), we make their internal state partially observable and thus more interpretable. This could be as simple as having the agent respond in a format: “Thought: ... Decision: ... Reason: ...”. This is similar to chain-of-thought prompting and lets the evaluator (and the developers/users) follow the logic. Many agent frameworks provide a memory of past dialogue which the evaluator agent can draw on to check for contradictions or verify that earlier constraints (promises made by the agent) are being honored. A Stoic agent might also keep a log of its “virtue scores” for each decision, which can be inspected.
Tool Integration: Equipping agents with tools improves accuracy and capability. For instance, connecting a math solver API or a database lookup means the agent can double-check calculations or retrieve canonical information instead of relying purely on its learned weights (which might be outdated or fuzzy). In a Stoic framework, using tools is like consulting an expert or oracle for what one doesn’t know – it’s a rational action to ensure correctness rather than guess. Tool usage can be orchestrated by having the main agent call a tool when needed, or by having a specialized Research Agent that proactively offers relevant information from external sources. Ensuring that the agent uses tools when appropriate can drastically increase reliability (no more arithmetic errors or forgotten facts).
Shared Knowledge and Ontologies: For multi-agent cooperation, having a common knowledge base or ontology helps avoid misunderstandings. If the agents share definitions of key terms and facts, the Stoic evaluator can reference the same knowledge as the solver agent. This prevents a situation where, say, the solver says something it believes is fine but the evaluator mistakenly flags it due to a misunderstanding. A shared ontology of ethical concepts could be particularly useful – e.g., a common library of scenarios labeled with virtue/vice outcomes, which the evaluator can use as precedents (similar to case-based reasoning in ethical AI). Computationally, this could be implemented via a knowledge graph accessible to all agents.
Formal Verification Components: For critical decisions, we might integrate formal methods (like model checking or theorem proving). For example, if the AI is designing a safety-critical system, a formal verification agent can take the plan and attempt to verify logical safety properties. Stoics believed in the rigor of logic, and incorporating a bit of automated theorem proving can be seen as enforcing strict rational consistency. While heavy formal methods may not be feasible for all tasks, even lightweight checks (like ensuring no logical contradictions in the plan’s preconditions and effects) can improve trustworthiness.
Communication Protocols: Effective orchestration may require protocols that define how agents speak and when. For instance, a turn-taking protocol with role-based turn ordering (Solver -> Evaluator -> Solver -> …) ensures the conversation doesn’t devolve into chaos. Alternatively, a publisher-subscriber model could be used, where the solver agent publishes its current solution and any subscribed evaluator agents automatically receive it and respond with feedback. This is analogous to event-driven architectures in software. Such protocols can be hardcoded or learned. In some multi-agent reinforcement learning, agents develop communication signals (emergent communication) to coordinate; here we can design the signals (natural language messages) for clarity. The model context (the prompt) can include system messages that instruct agents how to behave (e.g. “Evaluator: If the solver’s answer seems to violate a virtue, ask a pointed question about it.”). Clear prompting guidelines act as the “laws” of our mini society of agents, making their interaction reliable and predictable.
Consensus and Resolution Mechanisms: If multiple agents provide conflicting feedback, the orchestrator may need a way to resolve it. Voting schemes or confidence scores can be used – e.g., if we have three evaluators (one Stoic ethicist, one utilitarian calculus, one domain expert), and they disagree, perhaps the orchestrator defers to a weighted majority or prioritizes the Stoic evaluator on moral issues but the domain expert on factual issues. We could also spawn a mediator agent to analyze conflicting feedback and suggest a compromise or ask clarifying questions. The goal is to avoid analysis paralysis when agents conflict. With a good design, conflicts should be minimal (especially if each agent has a distinct scope), but planning for resolution enhances system robustness.
Many of these tools and methods contribute to interpretability (e.g. structured reasoning, shared knowledge), reliability (tool use, verification, consensus checks), and adaptability (learning from feedback, using evolving knowledge bases). By incorporating them into the model’s context and architecture, we create an AI system that not only makes better decisions initially but can also explain and refine those decisions in an ongoing process – much like a wise Stoic who continuously learns and remains steady under new challenges.
Stoic-Inspired Multi-Agent System Design
Bringing it all together, we propose a structured theoretical framework for a Stoic-influenced AI system. The system is composed of multiple specialized agents and processes that reflect Stoic philosophical guidance:
Problem-Solver Agent: This agent tackles the user’s query or task directly. It has domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities to draft a solution or answer. We imbue it with an initial prompt reflecting rational problem-solving and perhaps a Stoic mindset (e.g., “You are a logical, virtuous AI assistant…”), but its primary goal is to produce a correct and useful answer. It’s analogous to the “student” in a Socratic dialogue, or the actor in an actor-critic model (the one proposing actions).
Stoic Evaluator Agent: Acting as a combination of critic, mentor, and Socratic questioner, this agent evaluates the Problem-Solver’s output. Its prompt is crafted around Stoic principles – it might take on the persona of a Stoic philosopher (e.g., Epictetus or Marcus Aurelius) or simply an AI alignment guardian with explicit instructions to check for rational consistency, virtue alignment, and logical soundness. The evaluator does not directly give the final answer; instead, it provides feedback: pointing out potential errors, asking clarification questions, or suggesting improvements. Importantly, this agent follows the Socratic method: it often replies with questions or gentle critiques rather than blunt judgments. For example, instead of saying “Your answer is wrong/confusing,” it might ask “Have you considered whether that outcome is within your control?” or “Does this solution treat all users fairly?”. This prompts the solver to reflect and revise. The Stoic Evaluator can also have access to tools/knowledge to check facts and include that in its feedback (e.g., “According to data I found, your assumption is incorrect – does this change your conclusion?”).
Orchestrator/Manager: A central controller process coordinates the interaction. It provides the initial problem to the solver agent, then passes the solver’s answer to the evaluator agent, and manages the loop of revision. This could be an automated script using a framework like AutoGen or Langroid, or a simple loop in code. The orchestrator decides when the process should end – e.g., if the evaluator is satisfied or if a maximum number of iterations is reached. It may also collate the final answer and any explanation to present to the user. The orchestrator can enforce timeouts or step limits for practicality (Stoics also acknowledge practical limits – one can’t deliberate forever).
(Optional) Additional Agents: Depending on the complexity, we could include more agents: e.g., a Fact-Checker Agent as mentioned, or a User Proxy Agent that represents user preferences/values in the discussion (imagine the user can configure some moral preferences, and this agent reminds the others of those). For demonstration, we’ll focus on the main two-agent setup (solver + Stoic mentor), as it covers the essence of Socratic refinement.
The flow of the system goes through phases:
Initial Solution Generation: The Problem-Solver agent receives the task and produces an initial solution attempt (this may be a plan, an answer, a design draft, etc.). It uses its reasoning algorithms and possibly tools to do so. The output might include a rationale if we prompt it to show its work.
Stoic Evaluation: The orchestrator gives this output to the Stoic Evaluator agent. The evaluator reviews it for correctness, completeness, and Stoic alignment. It may use the virtue-check list or other criteria internally. The evaluator then responds, typically with some feedback. Three possible outcomes: (a) Approval – the solution looks good (rare on first pass); (b) Request for Clarification – if something is unclear or potentially problematic, the evaluator asks the solver to explain or justify a part of the solution (Socratic questioning); (c) Critique/Suggestion – if a flaw is found, the evaluator points it out and may hint at a correction (“It seems you assumed X, but that might not hold – perhaps consider Y.”).
Revision: The Problem-Solver receives the feedback. If clarification was asked, it answers the questions, providing more reasoning. If a critique was given, it attempts to fix the solution: maybe altering a step, reconsidering a condition, or rechecking a calculation. The solver then produces a revised solution or an explanation addressing the evaluator’s point.
Iterate: The new solution is fed again to the Evaluator. This loop continues until the evaluator agent signals that the solution is virtuous, accurate, and rational enough – effectively meeting the Stoic standard we set. In practice, we could stop when the evaluator has no further critical questions and explicitly says the plan is acceptable, or if we hit a loop limit (in which case the orchestrator might break the loop and take the best attempt so far or ask a human for help).
Finalization: The orchestrator outputs the final solution (possibly along with a summary of the dialogue as explanation). The user gets the answer, which has been refined through an internal Socratic dialogue and checked for ethical soundness.
This design ensures that before an answer reaches the user, it has undergone an internal vetting similar to a peer review. The Stoic Evaluator essentially serves as an ethical and logical gatekeeper, reducing the chance of the AI producing harmful or incorrect results. Moreover, the dialogue between the agents can be logged to provide an audit trail of reasoning – enhancing transparency, which is crucial for trust in AI. The use of Stoic principles means the AI is not just optimizing blindly, but constantly reflecting on whether it is doing the right thing in the right way. Next, we provide pseudocode and an example prompt dialogue to illustrate how this could be implemented.
Pseudocode Example of Stoic Agent Orchestration
Below is a high-level pseudocode for the interaction between a solver agent and a Stoic evaluator agent. This assumes we have functions (or API calls) to invoke the agents with a prompt and get their response. The pseudocode abstracts away the specific LLM API, focusing on logic:
pseudo
Copy
function solve_with_stoic_guidance(problem_description):
    # Initialize the roles with their system prompts
    solver_prompt = "You are a Problem-Solver AI agent. Solve the problem given, "\
                    "step by step, focusing on rational decisions. Provide a clear answer with reasoning."
    evaluator_prompt = "You are a Stoic Evaluator AI agent. Your role is to review the solver's solution. "\
                       "Check for errors, irrational assumptions, or unethical choices. "\
                       "Ask Socratic questions to clarify or improve the solution. "\
                       "Only approve when the solution is logically sound, factually accurate, and aligns with Stoic virtues."
    # The conversation context starts with the problem
    conversation = []
    conversation.append({"role": "user", "content": problem_description})
    
    # Phase 1: Solver produces initial solution
    solver_input = combine_prompts(solver_prompt, conversation) 
    solver_output = call_LLM(solver_input)  # sends prompt to LLM for solver agent
    conversation.append({"role": "solver", "content": solver_output})
    
    # Phase 2: Stoic evaluation loop
    loop_count = 0
    max_loops = 5  # safety break to avoid infinite loops
    while loop_count < max_loops:
        loop_count += 1
        # Evaluator reviews the latest solver output
        evaluator_input = combine_prompts(evaluator_prompt, conversation)
        evaluator_feedback = call_LLM(evaluator_input)
        conversation.append({"role": "evaluator", "content": evaluator_feedback})
        
        # Check evaluator's feedback for approval or need to continue
        if is_approval(evaluator_feedback):
            # If evaluator explicitly approves or has no critiques, break the loop
            break
        else:
            # Solver revises solution based on feedback
            solver_followup_input = combine_prompts(solver_prompt, conversation)
            solver_followup = call_LLM(solver_followup_input)
            conversation.append({"role": "solver", "content": solver_followup})
            # Loop continues with new evaluation
        
    # End of loop, prepare final output
    final_solution = extract_solution_from(conversation)
    return final_solution
In this pseudocode:
combine_prompts(system_prompt, conversation) is a helper that creates the full prompt for the LLM by combining a role-specific system message (defining the agent’s persona/goals) with the shared conversation history (which includes the user query, solver’s last answer, etc.).
call_LLM(prompt) represents sending the prompt to the large language model and getting a completion (this could be an API call to something like OpenAI GPT-4, etc.).
We maintain the conversation list to accumulate messages. Each message has a role label (“user”, “solver”, “evaluator”). The solver and evaluator roles are implemented by calling the LLM with different system instructions.
is_approval(feedback) is a function that checks if the evaluator’s message indicates satisfaction. For instance, it could scan for keywords like “looks good”, “I agree”, or a lack of any question/critique. If the evaluator still has questions or suggestions (likely containing a “?” or phrases like “have you considered”), then we continue the loop.
max_loops is a safeguard to stop after a certain number of iterations if, say, the agents keep going back and forth without resolution. In practice, we found that the evaluator agent prompt should be designed to eventually give an approval statement if everything is fine, to break out cleanly.
Finally, extract_solution_from would retrieve the latest solver content from the conversation (or possibly the last evaluator message if the evaluator delivered the final verdict). We might simply take the last solver message as the final answer to provide to the user.
This loop implements a basic Socratic refinement: the solver proposes, the evaluator questions, the solver reproposes, etc. It can be extended with more nuance, but even this structure greatly improves outcomes by catching mistakes. Notably, this pseudocode could be implemented using an existing multi-agent framework. For example, using AutoGen, one would define two agents with the given prompts and then use AutoGen’s conversation management to facilitate the loop (AutoGen can manage the turn-taking and stop conditions as well)​

. The logic would remain the same: a loop of messages until the evaluator is satisfied.
Example Prompt Dialogue
To illustrate how the Stoic-influenced agents might interact, consider a simple scenario: the user asks “Should I lie to get out of a difficult situation at work?”. This is an ethical dilemma rather than a factual problem, which is perfect to demonstrate Stoic principles. We will show a simulated dialogue between the Problem-Solver agent and the Stoic Evaluator agent:
User (Problem): “Should I lie to get out of a difficult situation at work?”
Solver Agent (Initial Answer): “In a difficult work situation, lying might seem like a quick escape. You could consider the consequences: a lie might relieve immediate pressure, but it could lead to worse trust issues later. Alternatively, honesty might be harder now but earns respect in the long run. If the situation is truly dire and no one gets hurt, one might justify a small lie to avoid big harm. So, perhaps a minimal lie that avoids major conflict could be acceptable, as long as you’re prepared to face it if found out.”
(The solver’s answer is ambivalent and seems to lean towards condoning a “small lie.”)
Stoic Evaluator Agent (Feedback): “You mentioned a lie might be acceptable if no one gets hurt. Do you think honesty is an important principle here (considering trust and integrity)? Also, is the outcome truly beyond your control, or could you handle the situation in a truthful way? In Stoic terms, lying might compromise your virtue of honesty (part of justice). Could you achieve a good outcome while still telling the truth?”​

(The evaluator doesn’t flat-out say “wrong,” but it reminds the solver of the virtue (honesty) and asks if a truthful approach is possible, hinting that integrity should not be sacrificed for convenience.)
Solver Agent (Revised Answer): “You’re right to emphasize honesty. In Stoic philosophy and good ethics, maintaining integrity is crucial. Lying, even if it avoids immediate harm, can erode trust which is hard to rebuild – something largely outside my control once broken. Instead of lying, I could try to explain the truth of the situation calmly and take responsibility for any mistakes, focusing on what I can control (my own actions and responses). This way I uphold honesty and face the consequences with courage. So, it would be better not to lie, but rather address the issue directly and truthfully, perhaps seeking a constructive solution.”
(The solver, guided by the questions, now gives a clearly Stoic answer: do the honest thing under your control and accept the outcome.)
Stoic Evaluator Agent (Approval): “That sounds like a wise approach. You’re prioritizing integrity and courageously facing the situation. This aligns well with ethical principles – maintaining trust and virtue is likely to lead to better long-term outcomes and self-respect. I agree with this solution.”
(The evaluator approves the revised answer as it upholds Stoic virtues and is logically sound.)
Final Answer to User: “It’s better to avoid lying, even in a tough spot. Instead, calmly explain the truth of the situation. By being honest and taking responsibility for what you can control, you uphold your integrity and maintain the trust of others – even if it’s hard in the moment, it leads to more respect and better outcomes in the long run.”
In this dialogue, we see the Stoic evaluator agent guiding the solver with Socratic questions: highlighting the principle of honesty and the Stoic idea of focusing on one’s own virtue (integrity) rather than fearing external consequences. The solver agent, upon reflection, changes its stance to align with Stoic ethics, producing a final answer that is ethically robust and likely more satisfying to a user seeking moral guidance. Throughout, the process is transparent – the reasoning was exposed and critiqued step by step. In a real system, we might not show the user every back-and-forth, but we could summarize it or at least be confident that the answer was refined and vetted internally. Another example (technical): Suppose the user asks for a decision: “Our inventory system is failing occasionally; should we rewrite it from scratch or just patch the bugs?” A non-Stoic agent might jump to patching as quick fix or complete rewrite if thinking long-term ROI. A Stoic evaluator might ask: “Are you considering what’s in your control vs not? Do you fully control the outcome of a big rewrite (which is risky), or could you methodically improve what you have? Also, are you exercising wisdom in understanding why it fails?” The solver might then provide a more tempered plan: e.g., “Investigate and fix root causes (what we can control now) before deciding on a full rewrite, which involves many uncontrollable uncertainties.” This would illustrate Stoic temperance (avoid drastic measures out of panic) and wisdom (seek understanding first). The pattern is consistent: the evaluator prompts reflection to ensure decisions are well-reasoned and virtue-aligned.
Conclusion and Further Considerations
We have surveyed existing work and concepts for integrating Stoic philosophy into AI, and used them to outline a practical multi-agent system design. Key takeaways include: focusing on internal reasoning and virtue over just outcomes​

, and orchestrating a Socratic dialogue between agents to refine solutions. The framework proposed employs a Stoic Evaluator as an internal guide and critic, ensuring the AI’s actions remain logical, ethical, and resilient. By leveraging modern multi-agent frameworks and tools (for memory, tool-use, etc.), we can implement this architecture in today’s AI systems. The end result would be an AI that not only solves problems, but does so with a form of practical wisdom – balancing effectiveness with ethical integrity, much like a Stoic sage in the digital realm. Ultimately, this Stoic-inspired approach is one path toward more interpretable, reliable, and adaptable AI. It shows how ancient wisdom can inform cutting-edge technology: an AI that knows how to get things done, and also whether it should, striving always to do the right thing in the right way​

. Such AI agents could be valuable collaborators, capable of not just answering our questions, but gently guiding us (and themselves) to better questions and answers through reasoned dialogue. The marriage of Stoic philosophy and AI engineering thus holds promise for building AI systems with a strong moral compass and robust decision-making frameworks – an encouraging step towards AI that we can trust and learn from.
