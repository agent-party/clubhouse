# Sprint 1: Foundation & Protocols

**Duration**: 2 Weeks  
**Objective**: Establish the foundational components and protocols for Clubhouse integration

## Overview

This sprint focuses on defining the core Protocol interfaces and implementing the base Clubhouse service registry. We'll create test harnesses, fixtures, and establish the foundation for subsequent development. Following our test-driven approach, all components will be defined with tests first, then implemented to meet those tests.

## Tasks & Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Core Protocol Definitions

- [x] **1.1 Define ClubhouseIntegrationProtocol**
  - [x] Write tests for protocol contract
  - [x] Define protocol interface with type annotations
  - [x] Document expected behavior with docstrings
  - [x] Create test fixtures for protocol implementation

- [x] **1.2 Extend Service Registry Protocols**
  - [x] Write tests for service registry extension
  - [x] Extend existing ServiceRegistry interfaces
  - [x] Add type annotations for all new methods
  - [x] Ensure 100% test coverage for new methods

- [x] **1.3 Create Agent Protocol Interfaces**
  - [x] Define base AgentProtocol interface
  - [x] Create capability interface definitions
  - [x] Write tests for protocol contracts
  - [x] Document protocol relationships

### 2. Clubhouse Service Registry Implementation

- [x] **2.1 Create ClubhouseServiceRegistry**
  - [x] Write tests for registry functionality
  - [x] Implement registry with Clubhouse integration
  - [x] Add service registration methods
  - [x] Implement service discovery

- [x] **2.2 Implement Configuration Management**
  - [x] Create Pydantic models for configurations
  - [x] Write tests for configuration validation
  - [x] Implement environment-based configuration
  - [x] Add configuration documentation

- [x] **2.3 Setup Clubhouse Server Lifecycle**
  - [x] Create lifecycle management interfaces
  - [x] Write tests for startup/shutdown hooks
  - [x] Implement async context managers
  - [x] Document lifecycle expectations

### 3. Test Infrastructure

- [x] **3.1 Create Test Fixtures**
  - [x] Implement mock Clubhouse server
  - [x] Create fixture factory functions
  - [x] Write helper functions for test assertions
  - [x] Document test fixture usage

- [x] **3.2 Setup Test Harnesses**
  - [x] Create integration test harness
  - [x] Implement mock Kafka for testing
  - [x] Write test utilities for Clubhouse calls
  - [x] Ensure test isolation and repeatability

- [ ] **3.3 CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**
  - [ ] Configure test runners
  - [ ] Setup coverage reporting
  - [ ] Create linting and typing checks
  - [ ] Document CI/CD workflow

## Deliverables

1. Core protocol definitions with 100% test coverage
2. Extended service registry with Clubhouse integration
3. Test infrastructure for all subsequent development
4. Documentation of architectural decisions
5. CI/CD configuration for automated testing

## Definition of Done

- [x] All tests passing with minimum 95% coverage
- [ ] All code linted and type-checked with mypy
- [ ] Documentation generated and validated
- [ ] Architectural decision records created
- [x] Code review completed with at least one approver
- [x] Demo of test infrastructure functionality

## Sprint 1 Retrospective

**Completed**:
- Successfully implemented core protocol interfaces with full test coverage
- Created service registry with robust integration patterns
- Established solid test infrastructure with mocks and fixtures
- Fixed implementation bugs and improved error handling

**Carried Forward**:
- CI/CD pipeline configuration will be completed in Sprint 2
- Documentation generation needs more attention
