# Sprint 4: Agent System & Security Infrastructure

**Duration**: 2 Weeks  
**Objective**: Implement agent system with enterprise-grade security infrastructure

## Overview

This sprint focuses on building the agent system with comprehensive security controls. We'll create a secure agent capability framework, implement security infrastructure including authentication and authorization, and add audit logging for compliance. This work builds on our enterprise foundation to ensure the system is production-ready.
