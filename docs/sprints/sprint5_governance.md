# Sprint 5: Governance & Resilience Framework

**Duration**: 2 Weeks  
**Objective**: Implement governance system and resilience patterns for enterprise-grade reliability

## Overview

This sprint focuses on building a robust governance and resilience framework to ensure the system can operate reliably in production environments. We'll implement circuit breakers, bulkheads, and other resilience patterns while creating a governance layer for system-wide policy enforcement and monitoring.
